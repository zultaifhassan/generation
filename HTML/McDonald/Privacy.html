          Please be assured that McDonald's uses its best efforts to protect the

            Information we collect and how it’s used
          </h6>
          <p class="mt-3">
            McDonald’s only gathers personal information, such as, first and
            last names, addresses, telephone numbers and email addresses, when
            voluntarily submitted by you. When a product is purchased through
            this website or through marketing / promotional activities (e.g.:
            via this website, in a store, over the telephone etc.), personal
            information may be requested (such as name, phone, email and
            address) in order to provide product information, marketing
            materials, provide newsletters, electronic newsletters
            (e-newsletters), provide new release / launch information, and
            advise of other McDonald’s products, competitions or events, which
            may be of interest. No one is obligated to provide personal
            information. However, failure to do so may result in McDonald’s
            being unable to provide you with upcoming promotion, event or
            product information and/or provide certain services including sales
            of products and after sales services.<br /><br />

            In common with many commercial websites we may also collect
            information which tells us about visitors to our website. For
            example, we may collect information about the date, time and
            duration of visits and which pages of the website are most commonly
            accessed. This information is generally not linked to the identity
            of visitors, except where the website is accessed via links in an
            email we have sent.

          <h6 class="text-danger fw-bold">Passive information collection</h6>
          <p class="mt-3">
            As you navigate through this website, certain anonymous information
            can be passively collected (that is, gathered without your actively
            providing the information) using various technologies, such as
            cookies, Internet tags or web beacons, and navigational data
            collection (log files, server logs, clickstream). Your Internet
            browser automatically transmits to this website some of this
            anonymous information, such as the URL of the website you just came
            from and the Internet Protocol (IP) address and the browser version
            your computer is currently using. This website may also collect
            anonymous information from your computer through cookies and
            Internet tags or web beacons. You may set your browser to notify you
            when a cookie is sent or to refuse cookies altogether, but certain
            features of this website might not work without cookies and this may
            limit the services provided by our website.<br /><br />

            This website may use and combine such passively collected anonymous
            information to provide better service to website visitors, customize
            the website based on your preferences, compile and analyse
            statistics and trends, and otherwise administer and improve the
            website for your use. Such information is not combined with
            personally identifiable information collected elsewhere on the
            website unless you have consented.<br /><br />

            “Cookies" are pieces of information that a website transfers to a
            computer’s hard disk for record keeping purposes. Most web browsers
            are set to accept cookies. McDonald’s may use cookies to make use of
            the website and services as convenient as possible. Cookies do not
            themselves personally identify users, although they do identify a
            user’s browser. Cookies allow McDonald’s to monitor the items an
            individual may want to access as they move through the website, and
            records how many people are using the different parts of the
            website.<br /><br />

            “Session" cookies are temporary bits of information that are used to
            improve navigation, block visitors from providing information where
            inappropriate (the website “remembers" previous entries of age or
            country of origin that were outside the specified parameters and
            blocks subsequent changes), and collect aggregate statistical
            information on the website. They are erased once you exit your Web
            browser or otherwise turn off your computer.<br /><br />

            “Persistent" cookies are more permanent bits of information that are
            placed on the hard drive of your computer and stay there unless you
            delete the cookie. Persistent cookies store information on your
            computer for a number of purposes, such as retrieving certain
            information you have previously provided (such as passwords),
            helping to determine what areas of the website visitors find most
            valuable, and customizing the Web website based on your preferences
            on an ongoing basis. Persistent cookies placed by this website on
            your computer may hold personally identifiable information, but only
            if you have registered or have otherwise consented to the retention
            of personally identifiable information you have provided at the
            website. Otherwise, our website’s server only knows that an
            unidentified visitor with your cookie has returned to the
            website.<br /><br />

            You can set your browser to accept all cookies, to reject all
            cookies, or to notify you whenever a cookie is offered so that you
            can decide each time whether to accept it. To learn more about
            cookies and how to specify your preferences, please search for
            “cookie" in the “Help" portion of your browser.<br /><br />

            A website may use Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP address is
            a number assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider
            so you can access the Internet and is generally considered to be
            non-personally identifiable information, because in most cases an IP
            address is dynamic (changing each time you connect to the Internet),
            rather than static (unique to a particular user’s computer). The IP
            address can be used to diagnose problems with a server, report
            aggregate information, determine the fastest route for your computer
            to use in connecting to a website, and administer and improve the
            website.<br /><br />

            “Internet tags" (also known as single-pixel GIFs, clear GIFs,
            invisible GIFs, and 1-by-1 GIFs) are smaller than cookies and tell
            the Web website server information such as the IP address and
            browser type related to the visitor’s computer. Tags may be placed
            both on online advertisements that bring people to the website and
            on different pages of the website. Such tags indicate how many times
            a page is opened and which information is consulted.<br /><br />

            “Navigational data" (log files, server logs, and clickstream data)
            are used for system management, to improve the content of the
            website, market research purposes, and to communicate information to
            visitors.

            McDonald’s may share personal information within the McDonald’s
            Family. The McDonald’s Family includes McDonald’s Pakistan Limited,
            our franchisees, our subsidiaries and our related bodies corporate.
            Of course, any use of this information by the McDonald’s Family will
            comply with this privacy policy. Occasionally, with your permission,
            we will send marketing information to you, such as discount coupons,
            information about new product offerings, etc. If you do not elect to
            receive such materials, we will not send them to you.<br /><br />

            Companies may be engaged by McDonald’s to perform a variety of
            functions, such as, fulfilling orders, assisting with promotions,
            providing technical services for our web sites, etc. These companies
            may have access to personal information if needed to perform such
            functions. However, these companies may only use such personal
            information for the purpose of performing that function and may not
            use it for any other purpose.<br /><br />

            McDonald’s does not sell personal information to third parties.
            However, with your permission, we will, on occasion send marketing
            information on behalf of one of our business partners about products
            or services they provide that may be of interest to you. You may be
            asked if you wish to receive marketing materials from McDonald’s
            business partners. If you elect to receive such materials,
            McDonald’s will not share your personal information with such
            partners but rather will send a mailing or e-mail on behalf of the
            partners.<br /><br />

            McDonald’s reserves the right to use or disclose any information as
            needed to satisfy any law, regulation or legal request, to protect
            the integrity of the website, to fulfil your requests, or to
            cooperate in any law enforcement investigation or an investigation

            McDonald’s is very sensitive to privacy issues. We are proud of our
            long-time commitment to our customers. We are especially careful in
            any communications with one of our most treasured customers –
            children.<br /><br />

            On our web sites, we offer many features, like games and colouring
            books, which do not require a child to provide any personal
            information. We collect only limited personal information from
            children 12 and under (like their email addresses) to respond to
            their online requests. For example, we may collect a child’s email
            address in order to send the child a screen saver, but we promptly
            delete the email address from our system. Or, we may collect a
            child’s email address in order to enter the child in a competition.
            We may also ask a child to provide an email address of a parent so
            we can notify the parent or seek consent. We may collect a postal
            address or a telephone number from a child when they enter a
            competition at our restaurants or when they join a birthday club.
            Whenever an in-store competition or a birthday club is aimed at
            children 12 and under, we will ask the child to seek the consent of
            a parent or guardian. McDonald’s will not condition a child’s
            participation in any online activity on the child’s disclosure of
            more personal information than is reasonably necessary to
            participate in that activity.<br /><br />

            Personal information collected from children is used solely by
            McDonald’s or other entities that provide technical, fulfillment or
            other services to McDonald’s. For example, such entities may provide
            services, such as, improving our web sites, fulfilling requests or
            administering competitions. This personal information is not sold or
            transferred to third parties.<br /><br />

            We urge parents to regularly monitor and supervise their children’s
            on-line activities.

            McDonald’s will endeavour to take all reasonable steps to keep
            secure any personal information recorded, and to keep this
            information accurate and up to date. The information is stored on
            secure servers that are protected in controlled facilities. Access
            is restricted to those involved in administration or fulfillment of
            the competition entered or of any request for which you have
            provided your personal information.<br /><br />

            In some cases these facilities may be overseas. McDonald’s employees
            and data processors are obliged to respect the confidentiality of
            any personal information held by McDonald’s. However, security of
            communications over the Internet cannot be guaranteed, and therefore
            absolute assurance that information will be secure at all times
            cannot be given. McDonald’s will not be held responsible for events
